To start this project make sure you've typescript, typings, nodemon, yarn

```bash
typings install
yarn install
```

To build the project: ```yarn run build```

To start the project: ``` yarn run start ```

To watch (compile and restart) the project: ``` yarn run watch ```

I recommend to work with visual-studio-code, because it's one of the most popular editor to write in typescript.
